                        <ul>
                            <li><b>If you have cold symptoms, such as cough/sneezing/fever, or feel poorly, do not come into the building.

                            <li>If you have a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, you can return to NVBH only after you’ve fully recovered, with a doctor’s note confirming your recovery.</li>
                            <li>If you are planning to travel voluntarily to a high-risk area with increased COVID-19 cases, we’ll ask you to quarantine for 14 calendar days before returning to NVBH. </li>
                            <li>Wash your hands after using the toilet, before eating, and if you cough/sneeze into your hands (follow the 20 second hand washing rule). You can also use the sanitizers you’ll find around the office.</li>
                            <li>Cough/sneeze into your sleeve, preferably into your elbow. If you use a tissue, discard it properly and clean/sanitize your hands immediately.</li>
                            <li>Open the windows regularly to ensure open ventilation.</li>
                            <li>Avoid touching your face, particularly eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands to prevent from getting infected.</li>
                            <li>If you find yourself coughing/sneezing on a regular basis, avoid close physical contact with your coworkers and take extra precautionary measures (such as requesting sick leave).</li>
                            <li>In accordance with the current mandate<b> all staff and clients are required to wear a mask inside of our buildings.</b> If you do not have a mask, a disposable one may be provided.  </li>
